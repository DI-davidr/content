This playbook blocks malicious IPs using all integrations that are enabled. By default, the blocked communication will be set to the outgoing (The blocked IP will be set as the destination).
Please note the following:
-  some of those integrations require specific parameters to run, which are based on the playbook inputs. Also, Certain integrations use FW rules or Appanded network objects
- Note that the Appended Network objects should be specified in blocking rules inside the system later on. 


Supported integrations for this playbook [Network security products such as FW/WAF/IPS/Etc]: 

* Check Point Firewall
* Palo Alto Networks PAN-OS
* Zscaler
* FortiGate
* Aria Packet Intelligence
* Cisco Firepower 
* Cisco Secure Cloud Analytics

| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| IP | An array of malicious IPs to block. Enter a list of IPs separated by comma delimiter \(i.e: 1.1.1.1,2.2.2.2\). |  | Optional |
| CustomBlockRule | This input determines whether Palo Alto Networks Panorama or Firewall Custom Block Rules are used.<br/>Specify True to use Custom Block Rules. <br/>For true statement - This option will create 2 FW rules inside the PAN-OS device. | True | Optional |
| LogForwarding | Panorama log forwarding object name. This will indicate what type of Log Forwarding setting will be specified in the PAN-OS custom rules. |  | Optional |
| AutoCommit | This input determines whether to commit the configuration automatically on PAN-OS devices. <br/>Yes - Commit automatically.<br/>No - Commit manually. | No | Optional |
| StaticAddressGroup | This input determines whether Palo Alto Networks Panorama or Firewall Static Address Groups are used.<br/>Specify the Static Address Group name for IPs list handling. |  | Optional |
| IPListName | This input determines whether Palo Alto Networks Panorama or Firewall External Dynamic Lists are used for blocking IPs.<br/>Specify the EDL name for IPs list handling. |  | Optional |
| EDLServerIP | This input determines whether Palo Alto Networks Panorama or Firewall External Dynamic Lists are used:<br/>\* The IP address of the webserver on which the files are stored.<br/>\* The web server IP address is configured in the integration instance. |  | Optional |
| DAG | This input determines whether Palo Alto Networks Panorama or Firewall Dynamic Address Groups are used.<br/>Specify the Dynamic Address Group tag name for IPs list handling. |  | Optional |
| ResolveIP | This input is required for the IP Enrichment - Generic v2. Will be used for resolving IP's hostname. Default: False.<br/>\(Input value: True/False\) | False | Required |
| UserVerification | Possible values: True/False.  Default: True.<br/>Asking for user verification for blocking those IPs. <br/><br/>False - No prompt will be displayed to the user.<br/>True - The server will ask the user for blocking verification and will display the blocking list. | True | Optional |
| InternalRange | A list of internal IP ranges to check IP addresses against. The list should be provided in CIDR notation, separated by commas. An example of a list of ranges would be: "172.16.0.0/12,10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16" \(without quotes\). If a list is not provided, will use default list provided in the IsIPInRanges script \(the known IPv4 private address ranges\). |  | Optional |
| SiteName | Signal Sciences WAF - Enter the Site Name for the integration to be applied. The site name can be found in your instance console. |  | Optional |
| CiscoFPName | Cisco FirePower - Enter the Object Group Name to be appended with the blocklisted IPs. |  | Optional |
| CiscoFPID | Cisco FirePower - Enter the Object Group ID  to be appended with the blocklisted IPs. |  | Optional |
| AkamaiNetworkListID | Akamai's WAF network list ID, which is mandatory to be mentioned for the integration. To this ID, the chosen IPs will be added. |  | Optional |
| CiscoFWSource | Cisco ASA \(firewall\) value for Rule's source object in the created blocking rule. Can be the value of an IPv4, an address block, or the name of a network object. |  | Optional |
| InputEnrichment | Possible values: True/False . Default: True<br/>Enrich Input IP address/es with reputation commands. | True | Optional |
